        Galleries are organized into groups. Consider what logical groups will
        be included in your gallery. Several groups will make for a nice
        browsing experience; for example, one for each homeroom in a grade
        level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the "Download Template" button once for each group you will make.
        A copy of the template will be downloaded each time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rename the files you just downloaded to correspond with the groups you
        are going to create:
        <ul>
          <li>Third Grade General Music.csv</li>
          <li>Freshman Band.csv</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace the placeholder data in each template with your students' data.
        Click on, "template help," if you can't open or edit them template file
        on your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload group files one after another in the order you want them to
        appear in the gallery.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the staging area at the bottom of the page, add a title and edit the
        default description for your gallery.
      </li>
    </ol>
