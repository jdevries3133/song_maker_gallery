# Welcome to the Music Lab Song Maker Gallery!

### Feature Request?

Do you have an idea for a killer new feature? Open an issue in the "issues" tab
and let me know! As you will see, there are already a few feature ideas on the
roadmap.

### Overview

This website was created by me, a music teacher, in response to the need to find a
simple way to feature our students' work in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our students' concerts have been canceled, their rehearsals ceased, and their
opportunities to share music diminished to a whisper of what they once were.

As an elementary general music teacher, a big part of my COVID curriculum has
been the [Chrome Music Lab.](http://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/)
Students love making creations with it; it's fun
and easy to use, and it provides an amazing platform for us to discuss the
topics in our music curriculum. For me, the music lab has been an
indispensable tool for coping with our school closure.

This website is a simple way to share your students' work with your whole
community. I know that I have been awestruck by the creativity of many of the
music lab compositions that my students have shared with me, and getting this
project off the ground has shown that hundreds of other music teachers feel
the same way.

### How it Works

The teacher posts links from
[Google's Music Lab Song Maker](http://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/).
This site captures student work by fetching and caching midi and json data
from google's api. The frontend then uses that data to display beautiful,
dynamically rendered thumbnails of students' work.

### Contributing

See
[our contributing guide](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details. Contributors are welcome! The local development environment is
(hopefully) very easy to setup. As you can see, I have a setup script that
does a lot of the heavy lifting and you don't need any credentials or anything
to start developing.

As you can see, there is even a setup script for an extra easy start, which I
have tested on Mac and Ubuntu Linux.
