# Welcome to the Music Lab Song Maker Gallery!

### Feature Request?

Do you have an idea for a killer new feature? Open an issue in the "issues" tab
and let me know! As you will see, there are already a few feature ideas on the
roadmap.

### Overview

This website was created by me, a music teacher, in response to the simple need
to find a way to feature our students' work in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our students' concerts have been canceled, their rehearsals ceased, and their
opportunities to share music diminished to a whisper of what they once were.

As a third, fourth, and fifth grade elementary general music teacher, a big part
of my COVID curriculum has been the Chrome Music Lab. Students love making
creations with it; it's fun and easy to use, and it provides an amazing platform
for us to discuss the topics in our music curriculum. For me, the music lab has
been an indispensable tool for coping with our school closure.

This website is a simple way to share your students' work with your whole
community. I know that I have been awestruck by the creativity of many of the
music lab compositions that my students have shared with me, and I am sure that
you feel the same.

### How it Works

The teacher posts links from
[Google's Music Lab Song Maker](http://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/).
This site captures student work by fetching midi and json data from google's
api. The frontend then uses that data to display beautiful, dynamically
rendered thumbnails of students' work.

### Contributing

See
[our contributing guide](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details. Contributors are welcome! The local development environment is
(hopefully) very easy to setup. As you can see, I have a setup script that
does a lot of the heavy lifting and you don't need any credentials or anything
to start developing.

As you can see, there is even a setup script for an extra easy start on
Mac/Linux.

### Roadmap

These are some major new features I'm implementing now or would like help with.

**Submission Links**

One of the pain points of using this site is that the teacher has to gather many
links, and has to upload one spreadsheet for each group. I would like to make a
submission link available to the teacher that they can share with their
students. Students can submit their song links themselves, saving the teacher
the work of gathering their students' work.

See [#10](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery/issues/10) if you
are interested!

**Student Response**

"Responding," is a key tenet of music curricula. I would like to create an
environment where students can respond to and critique each other's work while
also being monitored by the teacher.
